# EDA Netflix Dataset
 Exploratory Data Analysis on Netflix Dataset



This is my first GitHub repository. Here we are going to explore about Netflix dataset. Below are some of the
major findings from the EDA

1. Understanding the count of Movies & shows in the given dataset and which one is dominant.
2. Dissecting more about the genres and count of TV shows and Movies added to them.
3. Understanding the year-on-year count of movies and TV shows added in them.
4. Finding out the country which has produced most of the content in Netflix.
5. Actors who are more popular on Netflix.

These are few basic things found and this repo will get updated weekly up to a month. For more interesting findings by the end of 
Feb 2023. We will have a Tableau dashboard and other important findings of the data posted in the jupyter source file.
